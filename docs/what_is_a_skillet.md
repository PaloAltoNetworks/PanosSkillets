# What is a Skillet anyway?

A skillet is just a collection of templates with a bit of meta-data that goes along with them. Meta-data can include things like a 
name for the collection, a type that describes how the templates can be consumed, a description, optional labels, etc.

All skillets can be consumed by Panhandler, though other apps may exist to consume specific skillets as well.
