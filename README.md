# Skillets

A skillet is just a collection of templates with a bit of meta-data that goes along with them. Meta-data can include things like a 
name for the collection, a type that describes how the templates can be consumed, a description, optional labels, etc.

What's up with the [name 'Skillets' anyway?](https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/Skillets-Blogs/The-Palo-Alto-Networks-Skillet-Story/ba-p/308056)

## Skillet types

Although most skillets consist of loadable PAN-OS configurations, Panhandler can also load additional types
of Skillets including:

* PAN-OS
* Terraform
* Python
* REST

For more information, see the Panhandler [documentation](https://panhandler.readthedocs.io).
