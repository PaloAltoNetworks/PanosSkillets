# Docker Terraform Example

This example shows how to use the 'docker' skillet type. In this case, we will 
pull a terraform image, create a container, and execute a single command. This container
will then be removed.

## Example Script

There is also an example python script that shows how to use 
[Skilletlib](https://github.com/paloaltonetworks/skilletlib) to load and execute this skillet.
