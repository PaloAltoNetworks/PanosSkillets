# Docker Shell Script Example

Using a docker skillet, you can execute any shell script, using any available tools in the docker image. This
allows you to distribute custom tools and scripts, or use existing dockerized tools, as a skillet. This is a 
great way to use the benefits of docker while allowing non-technical staff to utilize your automation capabilities
through the use of Skillets.

## Example Script

There is also an example python script that shows how to use 
[Skilletlib](https://github.com/paloaltonetworks/skilletlib) to load and execute this skillet.
